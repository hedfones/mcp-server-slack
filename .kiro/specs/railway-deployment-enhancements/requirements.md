# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the Slack MCP Server to support deployment on Railway.app with IPv6 compatibility and remote MCP server functionality. The enhancements will enable the server to run as a cloud-hosted service accessible over the internet, expanding beyond local-only usage while maintaining security and performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy the Slack MCP Server on Railway.app, so that I can run it as a cloud service without managing infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is deployed to Railway THEN the system SHALL include a railway.toml configuration file
2. WHEN Railway builds the project THEN the system SHALL use the existing Dockerfile for containerization
3. WHEN the service starts on Railway THEN the system SHALL bind to the correct port using Railway's PORT environment variable
4. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN the system SHALL support Railway's environment variable injection
5. IF the service fails to start THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages in Railway logs

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the server to support IPv6 networking, so that it can operate in modern network environments and cloud platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL bind to both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
2. WHEN clients connect via IPv6 THEN the system SHALL handle requests correctly
3. WHEN the server is configured for SSE transport THEN the system SHALL accept IPv6 connections
4. IF IPv6 is not available THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to IPv4 only
5. WHEN logging network activity THEN the system SHALL properly format IPv6 addresses

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an AI developer, I want to use the MCP server remotely over HTTP/HTTPS, so that I can integrate it with cloud-based AI services and distributed systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server runs in remote mode THEN the system SHALL expose MCP functionality over HTTP/HTTPS
2. WHEN clients connect remotely THEN the system SHALL maintain MCP protocol compatibility
3. WHEN handling CORS requests THEN the system SHALL allow configured origins for browser-based clients
4. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL maintain MCP protocol compatibility over HTTP
5. IF network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the remote server to have basic security measures for private network deployment, so that the service operates safely within the trusted network environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server runs remotely THEN the system SHALL include basic security headers in responses
2. WHEN rate limiting is enabled THEN the system SHALL throttle requests per client to prevent abuse
3. WHEN CORS is configured THEN the system SHALL handle cross-origin requests appropriately
4. IF the server receives malformed requests THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP error codes
5. WHEN logging security events THEN the system SHALL record relevant connection and request information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the server to have proper health checks and monitoring endpoints, so that I can ensure service reliability in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server is running THEN the system SHALL provide a health check endpoint at /health
2. WHEN health checks are performed THEN the system SHALL verify Slack API connectivity
3. WHEN metrics are requested THEN the system SHALL provide basic operational metrics
4. IF the service is unhealthy THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 503 Service Unavailable
5. WHEN logging is configured THEN the system SHALL output structured logs for monitoring systems
